          <p>Ever since our fabulous forefathers, foremothers and fore-gender-nonconforming persons
            came to the United States aboard the little-known vessel 'The Gayflower,'
            the struggle for self-exploration, individual liberty, and the right to relate consensually
            to others how we please has been underway. At first the Pilgrims thought of those aboard the Gayflower
            as rather silly fellows, but soon it became clear that there was a war to wage for hearts and minds.</p>
